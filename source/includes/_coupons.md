# Coupons

Coupons are a great way to offer discounts or credit vouchers to your customers. They can be used together with multiple business models: Orders, Invoices and Subscriptions.


## Coupon Object

Attributes | Types | Description
---------- | ----- | -----------
**name** | `string` | Name of the coupon
**code** | `string` | The code to be used by a customer. By default, the code is automatically generated (a string of 6 characters long, e.g: Nz42kL), but you can also create our own.
percent_off | `number` | The discount percentage, should be between `0.` and `1.`, for example: 0.2 means 20% of the total amount.
amount_off | `number` | Discount amount, for example: 100.50, means that the next payment will be decreased by 100.50.
currency | `string` | ISO 4217 code of currency, for example: "EUR"
starting_date | `object` | Define when the coupon can start being used. By default, it'll start at the time of creation, but it could be defined for the future. If defined in the future, it means the coupon cannot be used before the `starting_date`. `timestamp` format. _Default `now`_
ending_date | `object` | The expiry date of the coupon. `timestamp` format.
max_redemptions | `integer` | The number of times a coupon can be used. When the `used_count` is equal to the `max_redemption` then the coupon becomes unusable.
used_count | `integer` | Automatically incremented by each use.


As you can see, there are two types of discounts: percent_off and amount_off.
It's important to remember: a coupon can only have one of them at the same time.
But if you want to change the type of discount you can do it easily with a `PUT coupons/<coupon_id>` (There is an example [here](#switch-the-discount-type))
<br/>
<aside class="notice">
There are 3 different ways a Coupon can become unusable:
 <br/>- When the `ending_date` is the current date
 <br/>- When the `max_redemptions` is reached
 <br/>- It's also possible to combine `ending_date` and `max_redemptions`. In that case, the coupon will become unsuable if `max_redemptions` is reached or at the `ending_date`.

### Switch The Discount Type

In the example we assume the coupon `57ee9c72d76d431f85222420` has a `percent_off` discount type, and we are going to change its type to `amount_off`.
<br/>To do it you just have to put `amount_off` and the value in the data, of course you can do the reverse as well, change the `amount_off` to the `percent_off` type.
