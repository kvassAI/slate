# Metrics

This section describes the collection, aggregating and receiving of metrics automatically 
generated on the KVASS platform while processing different tasks.

It is also possible to create custom metrics over the API and to receive these over the API.


## The Metric Object
Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -------
name | `string` | The index key of the metric
time_stamp | `object` | The date of the metric as a time stamp
count | `float` | The number of instances of name per time unit
sum_values | `float` | The sum of count per time unit
key | `string` | ID field. Composed of the company's uuid, the metric name and the time stamp
values | `array` | An array of values, from a date to a date, which represent the values of all different points/dots for an interval.</br></br>Think about a time series graph. You have time (period) on the x-axis and values on the y-axis</br></br>The `_meta` file describes the from and to dates on the x-axis and the resolution. While the `values` are the points on the graph, marking the value on the y-axis.</br>So if you are getting daily values for 30 days, there are 30 different `values` in a list, one value for each day.

</br></br>
The `name` of the metric usually has a primary key and multiple secondary keys. 
These are separated with a dot, `.`. For example `foo.bar`.
</br>
This is for grouping the metrics based on some commonalities.
An example of this is the metrics aggregated for every API request. The primary key is `requests`,
This key has multiple secondary keys, like `type` and `status_code`. The metrics for
`requests.type.POST` returns statistics for all `POST` requests. 
`requests.status_code.200` returns statistics for all requests with an HTTP status code 200.


## Get Metrics by Name

This endpoint returns the count, sum of values and an array of metrics for a given name between two dates
and [`resolution`](#metric-resolutions). The example returns the stats for the metric name `foo` for 2 days
with a daily resolution.
It returns the metrics for both `foo.zoo` and `foo.bar`.

> Definition

```
GET https://api.kvass.ai/metrics/<name>?resolution=day
```

> Example request:

``` http
GET /metrics/foo HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
X-Kvass-Api-Key: <kvass-api-key>
Host: api.kvass.ai
```

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"foo.bar": 
    {"count": 1.0, 
    "values": [0.0, 1.0], 
    "total_sum": 1.0}, 
 "foo.zoo": 
    {"count": 1.0, 
    "values": [2.0, 0.0], 
    "total_sum": 2.0}
 "_meta": 
    {"resolution": "day", 
    "from_date": "2018-04-07T00:00:00+00:00", 
    "to_date": "2018-04-08T23:59:59.99999+00:00"}, 
}

```


Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -------
from_date | `number` | The date as a time stamp the metrics will be aggregated from. _Default is the day before today_
to_date | `number` | The date as a time stamp the metrics will be aggregated to. _Default is today_
resolution | `string` | One of [`metric resolutions`](#metric-resolutions)
metrics | `stirng` | Filter results by sub-keys under the metric name in the request. See [`under`](#get-metrics-by-multiple-keys)


## Get Metrics Filter by Multiple Keys

It is also possible to filter metrics on multiple sub-keys on a given `name`. 
This is the same endpoint as [`get metrics by name`](#get-metrics-by-name), but with the 
query parameter `metrics`.
 
Getting stats on API usage (requests) is a good example on this. 
The main API request types are `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `OPTIONS`.
If you use `GET /metrics/request` in [`get metrics by name`](#get-metrics-by-name), you will get all
requests, regardless of type. 

If you want to filter by `POST` and `GET` request you could use this method.
