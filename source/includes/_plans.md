# Plans

The Plans method is utilized by the [`Subscriptions`](#subscriptions) method.
Its main feature is to set the billing cycle, currency, product items and
the duration of a subscription. The `interval_unit` and the billing_interval`
are the most important fields and define the period of time between
each subscription action and each payment. The next billing and interval dates are
calculated from the starting date of the subscription.

Only Admins can create, edit or delete a plan.
If your company want to allow your customers to create plans,
see `Create Subscription with a pre-set company specific Plan` in the [`Subscriptions`](#subscriptions) section.

### Plan items

The plan can contain items as a list. These items describe the products the plan is based on.
The items consist of a [`product`](#products), `quantity` and `discount`
The `quantity` describes the number of that product. The `discount` sets the percent of
discount of that product, from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is no discount and 1.0 is a 100% discount.
The `total_amount` of the plan will be calculated from the total sum of the products.


## Create a new Plan

This creates a new plan. The plan is not [`user`](#users) specific,
but a user could create a plan based on their demands. If you
want a non-customizable plan, <br> set `static_plan` to `true`
when creating a new plan.

## The Recurring Order Plan
Unlike the basic plan, the `Recurring Order Plan` can be created by a non-admin user.

The `Recurring Order Plan` can either be paid per order or periodically every week or month.
The `Recurring Order Plan` has these attributes, in addition to the attributes inherited by the basic plan.

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -------
**user** | `string` | [`User`](#Users) referenced by user_id who is associated with the plan. A User object` is returned in the response. 
**interval_unit** | `string` | The frequency of the subscription. <br>Choices: `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`<br>
**recurring_days** | `array` | An array of [`RecurringDay`](#recurring-day). Defines schedule.
**billing_interval** | `string` | Defines the billing frequency. <br> Choices: `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `MONTH_END`, `PER_ORDER`
method | `string` |  The plan type: `recurring_order`. 
name | `string` | The name of the plan. _default is `RECURRING_ORDER_PLAN`_


### Recurring Day
A Recurring Order Plan must contain recurring days as a list.
The recurring_days list contains the parameters that decide when the orders are set to be scheduled.
The parameters to select the schedule are day, hour and minute.
This is relative to the [`Plan`](#plans)'s interval unit.
For example, if the `interval_unit` is set to WEEK, the value of `day` could be between 0 and 6.

Number | Day
----- | ----
0 | Monday
1 | Tuesday
2 | Wednesday
3 | Thursday
4 | Friday
5 | Saturday
6 | Sunday

If the `interval_unit` in the [`Plan`](#plans) is `MONTH`, the `day` is the day of the month. For example, if you want to set a monthly schedule for the 2nd day of every month, set `day` to `2` and the `interval_unit` in the [`Plan`](#plans) to `MONTH`.

If you want the schedule to be the last day of every month, set the `day` parameter to `31`. If the `day` parameter is greater than the number of days for that month, the order is scheduled for the last day of that month.

You could also choose the time of day by using the parameters `hour` and `minute`. If not set, the time of day will be set by the initial order.

This us how to create a new recurring order plan. The plan is [`user`](#users) specific.
